# Classes-and-Objects-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study classes and objects in C++

##**THEORY**:
<p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language.<br>
Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".<br>
A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.<br>
When a class is defined, only the specification for the object is defined; no memory or storage is allocated.<br>
To use the data and access functions defined in the class, we need to create objects.</p>

**Syntax**
<p>class Class name {    // The class<br>
  public:               // Access specifier<br>
    int variablename;   // Attribute (int variable)<br>
    string variable name;  // Attribute (string variable)<br>
};</p>
